# Cross Quantilogram Analysis of Economic Policy Uncertainty, Macroeconomic Shocks and Systemic Risk in India   
### Course Project for ECON F414 - Financial Risk Analytics and Management

This research project investigates the dynamic interrelationships between Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU), Macroeconomic Shocks (MS), and Systemic Risk (SYS) in the Indian financial system using monthly data from January 2000 to June 2024. Employing the Cross-Quantilogram (CQ) methodology, we analyze how these variables interact across different quantiles and time lags, capturing both immediate and delayed effects during normal and crisis periods.

Our findings reveal that:

EPU has a strong and immediate influence on systemic risk, particularly during periods of financial instability.

Macroeconomic shocks affect systemic risk with a significant time lag, offering a policy window for mitigating interventions.

The relationship between MS and EPU is weak and delayed, indicating limited causal feedback.

We construct EPU indices using newspaper-based keyword search, estimate systemic risk using the Î”CoVaR approach via DCC-GARCH modeling, and extract macroeconomic shock indices through principal component analysis of various Indian macroeconomic indicators.

This project highlights the critical role of transparent and proactive policymaking in managing systemic vulnerabilities in emerging economies. The repository contains code, data processing scripts, and visualization tools for replicating our empirical analysis.
